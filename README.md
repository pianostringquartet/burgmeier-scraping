Retrieving the paintings of Max Burgmeier (Swiss, 1881-1947)

"Burgmeier's art draws from two different sources: the southern German landscape painting around Hans Thoma (also imparted to the artist through the Gattiker-Kreis), and the works of the artists who represented Ferdinand Hodler's legacy. By convincingly processing these suggestions, Burgmeier made a contribution to the history of Swiss landscape painting that should not be underestimated."
